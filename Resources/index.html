                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>HI! I'm Claudio an aspiring developer, currently dedicating my free time to studying coding as I
                        make
                        the shift from a background in customer service and hospitality to a career in web development.


                    </p>
                    <p>After high school, I initially pursued vocational training to become a medical assistant but
                        decided
                        to change direction and started working at a fitness center. It was there that I encountered a
                        technical issue with one of the computer programs, which led me to discover what I later learned
                        were the developer tools in the Mozilla Firefox browser.</p>
                    <p>That experience sparked my curiosity and
                        motivated me to research and dive deeper into the world of programming. So far, I've developed
                        skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to keep building on this foundation as I
                        grow
                        in the field.
                    </p>
